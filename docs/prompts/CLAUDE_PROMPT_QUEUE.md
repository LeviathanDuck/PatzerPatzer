# Claude Prompt Queue

Use this file to store Claude Code prompts that are ready to run in a future Claude session.

## How to use it

- Add full copy-paste-ready prompts here when they are created.
- Do not add review status here.
- Do not add queue status text by default. A queued prompt is simply present in this file.
- Add a scan-friendly Markdown heading immediately before each prompt block:
  - format: `## prompt-id - short task title`
  - keep this heading outside the fenced prompt block
- Use plain fenced Markdown blocks with no language tag for queued prompts.
- Keep the prompt metadata header near the top of each prompt:
  - `Prompt ID: CCP-###`
  - `Task ID: CCP-###`
  - `Parent Prompt ID: CCP-###` if this is a follow-up fix prompt
  - `Source Document: docs/...`
  - `Source Step: ...`
- For a follow-up fix prompt:
  - `Prompt ID` must use the next `-F#` modifier, such as `CCP-013-F1`
  - `Task ID` must stay the root family id, such as `CCP-013`
  - `Parent Prompt ID` should point to the reviewed prompt being fixed
- Once a queued prompt has actually been used in Claude Code and then reviewed:
  - remove it from this file
  - add or update its reviewed entry in `/Users/leftcoast/Development/PatzerPatzer/docs/prompts/CLAUDE_PROMPT_LOG.md`

## CCP-015-F1 - Hide Engine Guidance During Retrospection

```
Prompt ID: CCP-015-F1
Task ID: CCP-015
Parent Prompt ID: CCP-015
Source Document: docs/NEXT_STEPS.md
Source Step: Priority 3, Item 10

Task: Take the smallest safe follow-up step on the current-game retrospection flow by hiding engine guidance while Learn From Mistakes / retrospection mode is active, so the user is not shown engine lines or arrows while trying to find the move.

Treat this as a focused follow-up fix for the current retrospection experience, not as permission to redesign the engine UI or disable the engine backend entirely.

Before editing, inspect the current codebase first and confirm the real implementation points instead of guessing. Start with:
- `src/main.ts`
- `src/ceval/view.ts`
- `src/engine/ctrl.ts`
- `src/analyse/ctrl.ts`
- `src/analyse/retroCtrl.ts`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
- `docs/reference/lichess-retrospection/README.md`
- `docs/reference/lichess-retrospection-ux/README.md`

Relevant Patzer Pro files already identified from current repo inspection:
- `src/main.ts`
- `src/ceval/view.ts`
- `src/engine/ctrl.ts`
- `src/analyse/ctrl.ts`
- `src/analyse/retroCtrl.ts`

Because this task affects analysis-board and retrospection behavior, inspect relevant Lichess source before deciding implementation details. Start with:
- `~/Development/lichess-source/lila/ui/analyse/src/view/tools.ts`
- `~/Development/lichess-source/lila/ui/analyse/src/view/components.ts`
- `~/Development/lichess-source/lila/ui/analyse/src/ctrl.ts`
- `~/Development/lichess-source/lila/ui/analyse/src/retrospect/retroCtrl.ts`
- `~/Development/lichess-source/lila/ui/analyse/src/autoShape.ts`

Current repo-grounded diagnosis:
- Patzer currently renders `renderPvBox()` unconditionally from the analysis board
- Patzer engine arrows are still built in `buildArrowShapes()` whenever the usual engine/threat toggles allow them
- retrospection state now lives on `ctrl.retro`
- this means the user can still see engine guidance while solving a mistakes exercise, which undercuts the whole point of the mode
- the smallest safe step is concealment, not engine shutdown: hide the visible guidance while retrospection is active, without changing saved settings or broader engine behavior

Lichess parity requirement:
- inspect how Lichess suppresses visible computer guidance during retrospection
- specifically compare:
  - `view/tools.ts` hiding ceval PVs during retro solving
  - `view/components.ts` `showCevalPvs`
  - `ctrl.ts` `showBestMoveArrows()`
  - `retroCtrl.ts` `hideComputerLine()` / related retro guidance suppression hooks
- if Patzer needs a temporary simplification, keep it minimal and call it out explicitly

Implement only the smallest safe step:
- hide engine PV lines while retrospection mode is active
- hide engine-generated arrows while retrospection mode is active
- keep the underlying engine state/settings intact unless a tiny reset is clearly required
- keep the retrospection strip and mistake-review controls intact
- do not redesign the ceval header or engine settings panel
- do not disable the engine globally unless inspection shows that visible concealment alone is insufficient
- do not bundle solve-loop fixes or broader retrospection work

A likely safe direction is:
- gate PV rendering in the ceval/analyse view layer based on `ctrl.retro`
- gate engine/threat arrow rendering in the engine layer based on `ctrl.retro`
- keep the decision near the actual owners of those UI surfaces instead of adding more orchestration logic to `src/main.ts`

Before coding, provide:
- prompt id
- task id
- parent prompt id
- source document
- source step
- task title
- relevant Patzer Pro files
- relevant Lichess files
- diagnosis
- exact small step to implement
- why that step is safely scoped

Then implement the change directly.

Validation is required after coding:
- run `npm run build`
- run the most relevant task-specific check you can for this behavior
- explicitly verify:
  - entering retrospection hides engine PV lines
  - entering retrospection hides visible engine arrows
  - leaving retrospection restores normal engine guidance
  - normal analysis behavior outside retrospection is unchanged
  - engine settings/toggles are not unexpectedly reset by entering or leaving retrospection
- report whether behavior changed intentionally
- report whether there are console/runtime errors
- report remaining risks and limitations, especially whether any guidance is only hidden during active solving versus all retrospection states

Also include a short manual test checklist with concrete user actions and expected results. Keep it tightly scoped to this change.

Output shape:
- prompt id
- task id
- parent prompt id
- source document
- source step
- task title
- relevant Patzer Pro files
- relevant Lichess files
- diagnosis
- exact small step to implement
- why that step is safely scoped
- implementation
- validation
- manual test checklist
- remaining risks

In your final report, repeat:
- `Prompt ID: CCP-015-F1`
- `Task ID: CCP-015`
```
